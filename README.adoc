= Ansible Tower Multi-Cloud Demo

This org keeps content I use for multi-cloud demos. Means to show application deployments to different cloud providers, AWS and Azure for now.

== Demo 1

Not really multi cloud...

* Show how to create a simple AWS instance job template
* Use survey to ask for number of instances
* Create restricted user to execute template

== Demo 2

Use toplevel Playbooks to deploy full stacks: 

* deploystack-azure
* deploystack-aws

Use different roles for AWS/Azure instance deployment and afterwards the same role for application deployments.

== Demo 3

Create workflow in Tower to:

* Run Template for instance deployment on AWS _or_ Azure
* Then run dynamic inventory update
* Then run application deployment Template
